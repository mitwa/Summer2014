This repository contains screen-shots of the end-product of my internship.

The goal was to create an Android application which will be used in a research study to understand the behavior and/or routine of the user.

The app collects data from multiple device sensors. Multiple contexts - including screen locking and an approved change in activity, such as walking to staying still - trigger the app to ask the user specific questions. The data is not only stored locally on the device, but is also synchronized with a server daily.

The 3 mobile images are of the Android application. These are the context-triggered questions.

The 3 website images are from the researcher site to browse the collected user data. Numerical data is presented as a scatter plot, location data is displayed on a map and raw data tables are available too.

I was the primary developer for the Android application and for the website back-end and front-end.

Note: Critical data is blacked out in images.
