This repository contains screen-shots of the end-product of my internship.

The 3 mobile images are for the Android application running. It is triggered to ask these questions based on specific sensor values.

The 3 website images are form the researcher site to view the data collected. Some of the data is in a scatter plot, some is in a table, and the location data is displayed on a map.

I created the Android application as well as the back- and front-end of the wesite.
